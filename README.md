# CBIR
This project implements a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system that searches for similar images within a database using extracted visual features.
It supports multiple feature extraction methods such as SIFT, HOG, LBP, GLCM, ORB, Harris, and deep learning models like VGG16 (CNN).
Dimensionality reduction is performed using PCA, and similarity measures such as Cosine Distance, Jaccard Similarity, Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and Cross-bin Dissimilarity are applied.

A graphical user interface (GUI) is built with PyQt5, allowing image upload, feature selection, and result visualization on a Canvas.
The project discusses implementation challenges, advantages, and performance results.
